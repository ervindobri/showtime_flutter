# showTIME

A personal project of mine to follow and track your favorite shows(& episodes).
You can search for news and browse your scheduled TV Shows.
After adding a TV Show to your collection, you can track its progress from Episode 1 until the Final.

- Firestore to store TV Show data
- Browse new TV Shows & add to your collection - using the FREE TVMAZE API (https://www.tvmaze.com/api)
- Check out the most popular shows - provided by the IMDB8 API (rapidapi)


## Flutter & Dart Technologies used

- Floor for local database storage - **floor**
- Secure storage with **flutter_secure_storage**
